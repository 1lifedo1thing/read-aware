/**
 * How each fixed-layout book (PDF, comics) was last viewed on this device:
 * its zoom — a fit and a factor over it (see `foliate-js/src/fixed-zoom.ts`)
 * — and where on the page being read the viewport's center rested
 * (`FixedLayout.viewFocus`) — and whether that view is locked for page turns
 * (`FixedLayout.setViewLocked`). The reading position itself names only the page
 * and roams with the library; this is the rest of the view, which answers to
 * this screen and window and so stays on this device.
 *
 * Keyed by library book id; a book viewed only at the default, from a page's
 * start, has no entry. Writes go through the KV queue, which publishes them
 * optimistically and rolls back — with `local-write-failed` — on failure.
