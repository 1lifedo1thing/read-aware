/**
 * The post-upgrade notice.
 *
 * It exists as a dialog rather than a header chip because a one-time
 * announcement has no business competing with the primary navigation. The
 * release notes come from the same hand-written registry the website
 * changelog serves — and versions the site hasn't curated (pre-releases) fall
 * back to one line plus the external link.
 *
 * The version to announce and the fetch both live in the container, so these
 * stories cover the bodies without a network.
