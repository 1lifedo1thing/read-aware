// READAWARE: the zoom of a fixed-layout book (PDF, comics), shared by the
// renderer and the app. Pure — no DOM — so the app imports it directly, the
// way it imports the chapter map, instead of through the engine loader.
//
// A zoom is a FIT plus a FACTOR over it. The fit says what "100%" means —
// the page's width across the reading area, or the whole page inside it —
// and the factor scales from there. Relative rather than absolute, because
// what a reader wants from a page is a relation to their window ("a bit
// larger than full width"), which stays true when the window changes; a
// page's absolute size means nothing across PDF points, comic pixels and
// pre-paginated EPUB viewports.
//
// `auto` is the fit each flow has always used: a continuous scroll runs the
// pages full width, a paged flow fits the whole page (or spread) on screen.
